Scripted parametric CAD models to reduce design time by 30%.

## Details

- Developed macros in SolidWorks using VBA to automate model updates.
- Created a parameter-input UI to adjust dimensions in bulk.
- Integrated design checks to enforce engineering constraints.

## Result

Successfully cut design iterations from 4 hours to under 2 hours per prototype.
